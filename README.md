# personalblog

Going to be used for my personal blog. Will be made with HTML, CSS and javascript as a beginner project. 
Longer down the road I want to use this as a real blog, maybe implement an database and using node.js for backend.
Will write about the daily life as an DBA managing Microsoft SQL server in a High availability scene, using WFC and Availability Groups.
